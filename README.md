# KCD Digital Herbarium

A project I used to learn how go, sql, and web dev in general 

built with the net/http library of go and htmx

This project is *Complete* and I will not be adding more to it

## stuff that I wanted to add but was too lazy
- location for ingredients,
- effects of potions, and
- wiki links on each page
